# HashMaps_g99Lesson
Lesson 31

HashMaps aren't that hard to understand but g99 did very botch job with their code & kinda their explaination.  Went over to TutorialsPoint where they provided a much clearer definition.  Not to mention why when you print out your map, it prints out of order.  Thing with TutorialsPoint is that I have to get use to their site key.

Jamenson taught/told me about **D.R.Y.** **Dont Repeat Yourself** in terms of coding.  This was mostly in ref to my BufferedReader repo where my 'close()' method in the finally block and it didn't need to be.  Jamenson said that during a code review, person would have gotten yelled at for adding more non neccessary lines of code and that it could've easily been put in the try block.  Again, reminder not to recreate the wheel, but to quickly find, save time, & execute.
